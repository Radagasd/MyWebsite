        <p style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold;">Hi, I’m Kelvin van Hoorn, a technical artist that loves to apply his knowledge of physics to making (compute) shaders, VFX, and anything else related to art.<p>
        <p>I’m a graduated MSc. of Applied Physics, and in my spare time I taught myself how to write shaders through the excellent tutorials you can find online. I enjoy working on stylised projects the most, because it forces me to look extra carefully at what I’m trying to achieve and only implement the essential parts.</p>
        <p>Below you can see a small collection of the things I’ve created, but be sure to check the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Showcases">Showcases</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials">Tutorials</a> pages for more art content.</p>

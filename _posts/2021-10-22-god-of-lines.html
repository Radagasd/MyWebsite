<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This scene is based upon the starting area of God of War (2018), but with a drawn style that is very much inspired by the drawings of <a href="https://twitter.com/blurring_my_day" target="_blank">Ma-ko</a>.</p>
<p>As you can guess the main focus of this scene are the lines you see on most objects. This is achieved by rendering a custom pass, that contains data based on UVs and a Voronoi texture. An edge detection algorithm is then applied to this render to get the final lines. The object outlines are done through depth edge detection.</p>

<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
<p>Besides Santa Monica Studio for creating God of War and <a href="https://twitter.com/blurring_my_day" target="_blank">Ma-ko</a> for his drawings, I’d also like to acknowledge <a href="https://twitter.com/harryh___h" target="_blank">Harry Heath</a>, who recreated one of Ma-ko’s drawings in Unity (<a href="https://twitter.com/harryh___h/status/1328006632102526976" target="_blank">link</a>) and had a small outline of how he did his lines. My shaders are very much inspired by his approach.</p>
<p>Furthermore I’d like to thank the people from the <a href="https://discord.gg/e9XnPFv" target="_blank">Technically Speaking</a> discord for their feedback and suggestions.</p>

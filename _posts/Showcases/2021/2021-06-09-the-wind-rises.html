<h1>Description</h1>

<p>Is it a boat? Is it a plane? … Yes, it’s a seaplane!</p>
<p>While working on my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2021/06/08/flowers-rustling-in-the-wind">flower scene</a> for <em>Harry Alisavakis</em> Discord challenge I listened a LOT to the soundtrack from <em>The Wind Rises</em> by <em>Studio Ghibli</em> (composed by <em>Joe Hisaishi</em>). So much in fact, that I had to model a seaplane and make it fly!</p>
<p>The model is inspired by a British inter-war period seaplane, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarine_Southampton" target="_blank"><em>Supermarine Southampton</em></a>. It was of course also inspired by the seaplane from <em>Porco Rosso</em>, another <em>Studio Ghibli</em> film.</p>
<p>The controls feel quite natural as I try to simulate the 4 forces that act on a plane: thrust, drag, gravity and lift. The first 3 are fairly straight forward, thrust goes forward (w.r.t. the plane), drag counteracts total velocity and the gravity is downwards. Only the lift is more difficult, but in its current state it is greatly simplified to be upwards (w.r.t. the plane) and scale with your forwards velocity.</p>
<p>Would people be interested in a game where you fly/sail stylised seaplanes in a semi-fantasy world? If so let me know, either here or on my <a href="https://twitter.com/KelvinvanHoorn" target="_blank">twitter</a>!</p>

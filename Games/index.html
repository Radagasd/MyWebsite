    <h1>Style Test</h1>
    <p><em>This is a style test text, with this first line being an emphasised line to make sure you read it.</em></p>
    <p>In this block I'll use several links, like <a href="">this one</a> or <a href="">this one</a>, but they go no where. Besides links we also have keywords, such as <b>functions</b> or <b>variables</b>. In a tutorial you  could expect something like, change <b>stepSize</b> in the <b>Fragment</b> function. If we want we could also distinguish between links that go to another <a href="">page</a> or <a href="">site</a>, and links that refer to <a class="a--local" href="">sections</a> within the page. I'm not sure yet if I want names, of people or models, to be bold or italic. It would either be <b>Lambert model</b> or the <em>Lambert model</em>. Another question is how combinations worked, like a named link such as check out <em><a href="">Kelvin</a></em>. Something else I haven't used but is quite cool are <span class="tooltip" rel="tooltip" title="I'm using dotted lines again here, so maybe don't have local links be different">tooltips</span>. I could use <mark>marked</mark> text as well, but don't know for what.</p>
